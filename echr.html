<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond">The European Court for Human Rights (ECHR) has
been&nbsp; established as  a full time court in late 1998, to enforce the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) over the countries members of the Council of Europe  (an entity that includes the countries of the European Union [EU], as well as other European countries). Applications after restructuring soared, with nearly 10,000 registered applications as of June 1999.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond">The newly reorganized Court has the potential to become  the foremost tool for the enforcement of human rights in Europe. The number of applications suggests a dissatisfaction with the judicial systems of several countries, and the need of an over-national remedy. Part of the activity of the Court has been related to the slowness and inefficiency of judgement by national courts.
For example, the Court&nbsp;
ruled against Italy (the EU country with the largest number of applications) in  cases of simple judgements that took several years to be reached.
Of 83 judgements in cases against Italy, about one half regarded violations of proposition 1 of article 6: “In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.”<br>
<br>
This indicates that the Court has been burdened by cases which are mostly “marginal” human rights cases, and that could be efficiently dealt in national courts, or in other courts whose focus is not on human rights. For example, cases concerning article 6.1 have been about the unreasonable length of eviction
procedures in Italy. Only in one case out of 83 judgements against Italy the subject of torture and ill-treatment in prison was brought to the attention of the Court.<br>
<br>
</font>
<font face="Garamond">It may be difficult that in the most homophobic countries in Europe&nbsp;
abuses&nbsp; against
gays and transsexuals could reach the Court. Not unlike what was not uncommon with rape's victims, gay victims
may be too often reluctant to expose themselves as gay, because the stigma&nbsp; may bring along further abuses and no
support.&nbsp;<br>
</font>
<font face="Garamond">
  <br>
A major limitation may be also the lack of explicit legal tools for the protection of
  homosexual and transsexual women and men&nbsp;in&nbsp; the European Convention of Human Rights.
Neither sexual orientation nor gender identity are mentioned in Article 14 (enjoinment of the rights set forth in the Convention).</font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond">In addition, in cases of transsexualism-related suits, the
judgment of the Court has been often against the applicants, with disappointing motivations. In the 1997 case of SHEFFIELD and HORSHAM v. THE UNITED KINGDOM, on&nbsp;<br>
</font>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Garamond">“authorities’ continuing insistence on determination of gender according to biological criteria and refusal to annotate or update information inscribed on register of birth to take account of post-operative gender status” –</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond"><br>
the court ruled that:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Garamond"><br>
  “… detriment suffered by applicants through being obliged to disclose pre-operative gender in certain contexts not of sufficient seriousness as to override respondent State’s margin of appreciation – situations relied on by applicants to illustrate detriment infrequent and requirement to disclose pre-operative gender in such situations justified – authorities have also sought to minimise intrusive enquiries as to applicants’ pre-operative status – no disproportionate interference with applicants’ rights to respect for their private lives.”<br>
  </font>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond">This means that any transgender woman has no right not to be “exposed as a transsexual”. The Court probably ignored the dramatic consequences  (even life-threatening) that such exposure may have. In another
case the Court ruled against the applicant, a transsexual woman who wished to marry a man:<br>
</font>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Garamond">&quot;In these circumstances, the Court does not consider that it is open to it to take a new approach to the interpretation of Article 12 (art. 12) on the point at issue.  It finds, furthermore, that attachment to the traditional concept of marriage provides sufficient reason for the continued adoption of biological criteria for determining a person's sex for the purposes of marriage, this being a matter encompassed within the power of the Contracting States to regulate by national law the exercise of the right to marry.&quot;<br>
  </font>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond">In all 7 cases on transsexuals brought to the attention of the
Court, of which 5 on violation of Article 8 (“Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence”),&nbsp;
judgment has not been in favor of the plaintiffs.<br>
