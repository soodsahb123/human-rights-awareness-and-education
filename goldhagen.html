<font face="Garamond">The Germans' deep anti-Semitism made the Holocaust possible. It was not a lone-man sickening madness; rather,
anti-Semitism was widespread and hate blinding.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679772685/humanrightsawa09">Hitler's Willing Executioners</a> by historian Jonathan Goldhagen has stirred a debate which has been both a source of surprise and of hope. It is surprising
that a thorough study&nbsp; which says what should have been obvious to most people that lived through the Thirties and
WWII appears&nbsp; only 50 years after the collapse of Nazi Germany.&nbsp; The source of hope is that, finally,&nbsp;
the right perspective is being pursued, even if Goldhagen's ideas are far from consolidated, and recent popularizations&nbsp;
turn back to old ideas capitalizing on rather misleading details of Hitler's personal history.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Goldhagen's analysis in the first two parts of the book shows primary evidence on how the most consolidated institutions as well as most people put anti-Semitism first, to the point of overriding even the main principles of their ideology. “The Catholic Church cooperated wholeheartedly in this obvious eliminationist and often lethal measure.” “Marxists, idelogical opponents of Nazism” -- and also a main force for Internationalism -- “were, on the issue of the Jews, in general accord with the Nazis.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Garamond"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679772685/humanrightsawa09">Hitler's Willing Executioners</a>&nbsp;
is for anyone wishing to&nbsp; ponder how, at any time, destructive feelings and ideas may resurface in disguise, and be aware that it may be much more easy to fall prey to them as they become socially accepted, than to oppose them. In this perspective Goldhagen's book will help to build our ability to recognize, and to oppose such forces in our own social environment.
