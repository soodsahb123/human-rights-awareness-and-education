heritage,

itself
time will bury in oblivion. The subterranean stream of Western history
has finally come to the surface and usurped the dignity of our
tradition.
This is the reality in which we live. And this is why all efforts to
escape

fact that the worst human right violations
take place with the silent consent of the wide majority. Without a
widespread
culture of human rights, democracy is not by itself a guarantee of
respect
of human rights. We
feel an obligation to recognize any situation that may eventually
compromise
the possibility of a serene and decent life for any number of people, <u>beginning
from the social environment we are living in.</u> <a

on these pages attempt to recognize present-day targets of
discrimination and hatred, and to signal and analyze situations - with
a special attention to
the social, economic and anthropological aspects -
in which people
assimilate and spontaneously accept discrimination and exploitation of
the civil rights of individuals and minorities.&nbsp;We believe that
the creation of a human rights culture
through education and information is the ultimate, even if long-term
solution
against human rights abuses.&nbsp;</font></p>

Indifference is the dead weight of history. Indifference works powerfully in history. It works passively, but it works. It is fatality; it's what you can't count on; it is that which upsets the programs, which overturns the better constructed plans; it is the brute matter that chokes intelligence. What happens, the evil that strikes everyone, occurs because the mass of men abdicate their will, lets promulgate the laws that only the revolt can abrogate, lets men rise to power which then only a mutiny can overthrow. Between absenteeism and indifference, a few hands, unattended by any control, weave the canvas of collective life, and the mass ignores, because they don't care; and then it seems to be fatality to overwhelm everything and everyone, it seems that history is nothing more than a huge natural phenomenon, an eruption, an earthquake which all fall victim to, who wanted and who did not want, who knew and who he did not know who had been active and who was indifferent.
