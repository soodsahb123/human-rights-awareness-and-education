Several millions of people perished because of  the Nazis’ genocidal attempt; even more are said to have perished because of deportations and executions in the Soviet Union
under Stalin's&nbsp; dictatorship. Thus the person of the XX<sup>th</sup> century is most likely to be one&nbsp;
who died in Nazis’ or in the Soviets’ concentration camps; but we may think as person of the century  anyone who lost his or her life  struggling for the peaceful affirmation of liberty and fundamental rights, like women that lost their reputation fighting for the right to vote or to practice the medical profession;  innocent victims of the many Fascist dictatorships that plagued Europe till the last decades, in Spain, Portugal, and Greece; homosexual and transgender persons who fell  victims of hate crimes just because they  wanted to reaffirm their identity; activists who died advocating the rights of persecuted racial minorities; anyone who  perished under the hands of torturers; the most forgotten people that “disappeared” and never came back because of death squads and state terrorism . . .&nbsp;<br>

Modern states have gathered unprecedented destructive power. Torture, mass murder and other abuses have been “industrialized” and put on a scientific basis. This has made it more difficult to  withstand them or even to recognize them. The fight against, and the denounce of the  most horrible abuses have been almost always discredited and  disregarded, as “subversion” or even as “madness”. Modern states – including the US and several countries that are now part of the European Union  – most often  did not acknowledge the struggle for civil and human rights occurring at a given time as a valuable struggle;  states and
governments rather  attempted to  discredit human and civil rights advocates as morally dubious, anti-social elements. Some of them became “nasty madmen”  if they attempted to lift the thick barrier of silence and complicity that governments, military and police wanted to keep over their crimes. The unspoken and buried  truth on the death of millions is almost always ignored by history
textbooks focused on battles and leaders. This barrier of silence  is really a high fence of barbed wire that separates the victims and human rights abuses from the “official” world – always “legal”, “progressive” and “fashionable” –  in which tremendous achievements have been possible during this century. The struggle against human rights abuses and for civil rights is  history that is still seen as “nasty”, “marginal”, as dealing with “things that have to be forgotten”, “things that do not happen anymore”, unless it is history that happened in a distant past and that does not involve living people anymore (as it is now the Holocaust) or that happened in a distant geographical location. Surveying
encyclopedias written for the youth in the Fifties and Sixties, one cannot be taken by the impressive optimism, desire of growth and progress, by the positive thoughts that permeate them. Nothing is to be found there, for example, about the Holocaust, which was then recent history.&nbsp;

 The first step to avoid the repetition of the heights in savagery and cruelty  achieved in this century it is to acknowledge the buried history of hatred – and to recognize the social, economical and anthropological factor that make hatred a driving force of collective behavior in the social environment we are living in. It is impossible to appreciated the tremendous technological progress of this century without considering the “subterranean stream” of death and
sufferance that co-existed with it, since it skirmished even some of the great intellectual creators – Albert Einstein and Alan Turing, to name just two – to which part of that progress can be ascribed.  Until everyone will not know about the  self-sacrifice and the efforts needed to fight for the affirmation of minority rights against the opposition of a whole society – let it be right  to gather,  to vote, to wear pants, or to cross-dress –  and be able to recognize the re-occurrence of same
exploitative patterns for different minorities, the value and the meaning of our most valuable not only social, but also intellectual and scientific conquests will be always in jeopardy.
